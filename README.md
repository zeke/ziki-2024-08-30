This is a thing that turns plain English instructions into working shell commands.

## The task

Turn an MP4 file into a series of frames.

## Usage

1. Edit [PROMPT.md](PROMPT.md) and describe the task in plain English.
2. Run `./go.sh` to invoke [yolox](https://ghub.io/yolox), which uses a language model to turn PROMPT.md into a working command.
3. ðŸŽ‰ Voila! Your video turns into frames and you didn't have to figure out the complicated commands to make it happen.
