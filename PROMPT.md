find the mp4 file in this directory.

use ffmpeg to break it up into a series of images, at every ten frames.

make a directory for the frames named after the basename of the mp4 file.

save the frames as jpg files in the new directory.

give each frame file a number with 3 significant digits.

example:

foo.mp4
foo/000.jpg
foo/001.jpg
foo/002.jpg
